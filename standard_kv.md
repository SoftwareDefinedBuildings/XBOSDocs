# Standard Key/Value Pairs

### Deployment-level

Typically these keys are applied further up the URI hierarchy so as to apply to all URIs in a deployment

* `Deployment`: The name of a particular deployment site
* `Zipcode`: The zipcode of the deployment site
* `Latitude`: the latitude of the deployment site
* `Longitude`: the longitude of the deployment site

### Driver-level

These keys are typically applied on a per-driver basis, i.e. at the "root" of the driver's URIs.
