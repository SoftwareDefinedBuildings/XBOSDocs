# Driver Interfaces

## Signals and Slots {#signalsandslots}

**Signals** are URIs on which a driver publishes data and state

**Slots** are URIs on which a driver receives input, e.g. actuation commands

**TODO:** decide on and document standard PO types for signals and slots

These are currently [under development](https://github.com/SoftwareDefinedBuildings/XBOS/tree/master/interfaces)

Discussion of these interfaces is taking place on the [XBOS issue tracker](https://github.com/SoftwareDefinedBuildings/XBOS/issues/1)
