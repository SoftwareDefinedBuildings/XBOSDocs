# Example: XBOS Thermostat Interface

Here we expand the [XBOS thermostat interface](https://github.com/SoftwareDefinedBuildings/XBOS/blob/master/interfaces/xbos_thermostat.yaml) into a tabular form, and explore the URIs and messages and PO nums and permissions involved.



For this example, we will assume the following:

* we are using 

#### Properties

Reproduce the list of properties for the tstat interface

#### URIs

Put a table of signal/slot URIs here and what's on those 

#### Messages

Go over what would be sent on the URIs
